Does this work? Nelsoncs02 :D

This is a guessing game. Actually, it is not a guessing game. It is an amazing chocolate factory owned by a man named Wonka.

It will think of a random number between 0 and 100,
then prompts the user to guess it.  

It let's the user make as many guess as possible.


It also prints the number of tries the user take to guess 
the correct number.
